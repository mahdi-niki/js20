   what is the difference between an asynchronous function and a synchronous function?
*/

// ! Answer
// Synchronous functions execute line by line, blocking subsequent code until they finish. Asynchronous functions allow other code to run while they're processing, usually with callbacks, promises, or async/await.

// Hmm, I should explain execution flow first. For synchronous, each line waits for the previous to finish. Asynchronous doesn't block, so other tasks can proceed. Maybe use examples like reading a file or fetching data where async is common.

// Next, error handling. Synchronous uses try/catch, while async might use .catch() with promises or try/catch with async/await. That's important for developers to handle errors properly.

// Performance is another point. Synchronous can be slower for I/O operations since it blocks. Async improves efficiency by allowing parallel tasks. Mention scenarios like APIs or file operations where async is better.

// Syntax differences: async functions use keywords like async/await or callbacks. Synchronous is straightforward. Maybe code snippets would help, but the user didn't ask for code. Maybe mention it briefly.
